# How to install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script is meant to be run on a RPi Zero 2W hooked to a Waveshareâ€™s 7.5inch e-Paper screen.
> To prepare the RPi correctly, please follow the [detailed write-up](https://literature-clock.arthurgassner.ch).

1. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
2. Create a virtual environment with `uv venv --system-site-packages`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--system-site-packages` gives our virtual environment access to system-wide packages.
> This is necessary because this script relies on the RPi's GPIO, and hence on `gpiozero` -- a system-wide package.

3. Install the necessary libraries with

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Ensure you're able to print to the screen by running `uv run hello_world.py`
