15:00|At <b>three o’clock on the afternoon</b> there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.|The Sign of Four|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
15:00|“Then good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at <b>three o’clock</b> I should like to chat this little matter over with you.”|The Sign of Four|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
15:00|The next afternoon at <b>three</b>, I went to meet the new teacher. When I stepped inside Julian’s office I was shocked. It was completely empty. The books, the rugs, the big round table were all gone.|The Secret History|Donna Tartt

15:00|When the alarm went off at <b>three</b>, though, I woke up feeling weird. I can’t explain it, but I just felt different.

Anyway, you’ve got this ruddy book flying out of every bookshop in the known world!”<br/>My face said what I had no words for.<br/>“Oh Christ, you idiot. What’s the repayment schedule?”<br/>I looked at my watch. “<b>Three o’clock</b> this afternoon.”|Cloud Atlas|David Mitchell
15:00|By <b>three o’clock</b>, the heat had morphed into a feral creature, a snake bent on prey. It hissed and slithered across the pavements, poked its flaming tongue through keyholes.

15:00|Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have been impossible: eating <b>three-o’clock</b>, after-dance suppers in impossible cafes, talking of every side of life with an air half of earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But he never realized how wide-spread it was until he saw the cities between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue.|This Side of Paradise|F. Scott Fitzgerald
15:00|The afternoon waned from the purging good of <b>three o’clock</b> to the golden beauty of four.|This Side of Paradise|F. Scott Fitzgerald
15:00|With some difficulty, James battled his way past waves of scent, screeching voices and glossy black hair. <br/>“What on earth is going on?” he asked when he reached the safety of his office.<br/>Carlo shrugged. “It’s <b>three o’clock</b>.”<br/>“I’m aware of the time, Carlo.

15:00|Ditched by the woman I loved, I exalted my suffering into a sign of greatness (lying collapsed on a bed at <b>three</b> in the afternoon), and hence protected myself from experiencing my grief as the outcome of what was at best a mundane romantic break-up.
