22:00|"Shanghai’s clocks were set an hour ahead so the city could ""save daylight"", but the Bai family said: “We go by the old clock.” <b>Ten o’clock</b> to them was eleven to everyone else. Their singing was behind the beat; they couldn’t keep up with the huqin [Chinese string instrument] producing bleak and desolate sounds of life."|Love in a Fallen City|Eileen Chang
22:00|It was at <b>ten o’clock</b> to-day that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then.|The Time Machine|H.G. Wells
22:00|This was a travelling fair, and we can imagine what a faint impression the public address system might have made against the caterwauling of shrieking teens, the clattering of the roller coaster, the thundering of the waltzer, the hollering of hawkers and hucksters, and the pounding basslines of fairground music. By <b>ten o’clock</b> when the noise had subsided, and when most of the revellers had dispersed into the night, no one had come forward to claim the little girl.|Coincidents: A Novel|J.W. Ironmonger
22:00|At night, a quiet so vast it seemed it seemed almost to reverberate. Few cars passed on Route 114, and after <b>ten o’clock</b> or so there were none at all.

22:00|It was <b>ten o’clock</b>. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall.|The Sign of Four|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
22:00|On Saturday nights I still sat in the same chair in the dorm lobby. I knew a phone call wouldn’t come, but I had no idea what else to do. I turned on the TV set and pre<b>ten</b>ded to watch baseball. And gazed at the indeterminate space between me and the set. I divided that space into two, and again into two. I did this over and over, until I’d made a space so small it could fit in the palm of my hand.<br/>At <b>ten</b> I turned off the TV, went back to my room, and went to sleep.|Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman|Haruki Murakami
22:00|Anyway, when he looked at his watch again it was <b>ten o’clock</b>. At <b>ten o’clock</b> she was lying on the divan with her boobies in her hands. That’s the way he gives it to me—in driblets.|Tropic of Cancer|Henry Miller
22:00|And now sometimes, in the very midst of things, sometimes when I feel that I am absolutely free of it all, suddenly, in rounding a corner perhaps, there will bob up a little square, a few trees and a bench, a deserted spot where we stood and had it out, where we drove each other crazy with bitter, jealous scenes. Always some deserted spot, like the Place de l’Estrapade, for example, or those dingy, mournful streets off the Mosque or along that open tomb of an Avenue de Breteuil which at <b>ten o’clock in the evening</b> is so silent, so dead, that it makes one think of murder or suicide, anything that might create a vestige of human drama.|Tropic of Cancer|Henry Miller
22:00|It was <b>ten at night</b> and everyone had gone home. I trudged up the dark stairway to clean out my desk. There was no sadness or nostalgia, only disgust that I’d wasted so much time on unnecessary labor when I could have been sleeping and feeling nothing. I’d been stupid to believe that employment would add value to my life.|My Year of Rest and Relaxation|Ottessa Moshfegh
22:00|D-Day. I reported to Ernie’s room thirty minutes after the Undead were put to bed at <b>ten o’clock</b>. “Last chance to back out if you don’t think you can hack it,” the artful Scot told me.<br/>“I’ve never backed out of anything in my life,” I replied, lying through my decaying teeth.|Cloud Atlas|David Mitchell
22:00|“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters.

22:00|While everyone ate, and I nibbled, Danièle said, “So this is the plan, Will. We will arrive at the entrance to the catacombs around <b>ten o’clock</b>.

22:00|At <b>ten o’clock</b> she went into her double cell, where the woman she shared with was already asleep, and there was the reassuring clang of the door and click of the lock.

22:00|Alone at the too-small child’s desk in her room, Eva finished the last line of the most pointless assignment ever, and though she wanted to start on the evening’s true mission immediately, she kept the box of churro bites closed under her bed. Her parents went to sleep at <b>ten o’clock</b> on weeknights. Only three and a half more hours to wait out.|Kitchens of the Great Midwest|J. Ryan Stradal

22:00|I went back into the library, limp and exhausted. In a few minutes the telephone began ringing again. I did not do anything. I let it ring. I went and sat down at Maxim's feet. It went on ringing. I did not move. Presently it stopped, as though cut suddenly in exasperation. The clock on the mantelpiece struck <b>ten o'clock</b>. Maxim put his arms round me and lifted me against him. We began to kiss one another, feverishly, desperately, like guilty lovers who have not kissed before.|Rebecca|Daphne du Maurier
