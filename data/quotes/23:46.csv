23:46|In the Kismet Lounge, Mr. Early sees suddenly to his horror it's <b>11:46 p.m.</b> He's been in this place far longer than he'd planned, and he's had more to drink than he'd planned. Shame! What if, back at the E-Z, his little girl is crying piteously for him?|Doll: A Romance of the Mississippi|Joyce Carol Oates
