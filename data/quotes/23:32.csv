23:32|This is the evening. This is the night. It is New Year´s Eve. In about twenty-eight minutes it will be midnight. I still have twenty-eight minutes left. I have to recollect my thoughts. At twelve o´clock, I should be done thinking.|The Evenings|Gerard Reve
23:32|"And then it started to rain and I got wet and I started shivering because I was cold.<br/>And then it was 11.32 p.m. and I heard voices of people walking along the street.<br/>And a voice said, ""I don't care whether you thought it was funny or not,"" and it was a lady's voice."|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time|Mark Haddon
