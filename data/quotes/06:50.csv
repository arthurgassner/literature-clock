06:50|That night I lay in my jangling single bed across from Sammy’s and I watched him sleep, and then I stared at the ceiling. I got up and took a blanket and went and made a cup of tea, and lay on the sofa and tried to read one of the wrinkled paperbacks. I blinked my way through a hallucinatory half chapter, set it aside and closed my eyes. I woke and it was six fifty, and I winced my way upstairs and lay down in my bed, to be there when Sammy woke up again.|The Body Lies|Jo Baker
