14:00|Mrs. Karlsson's eyes were big with surprise when at <b>two o'clock</b> she saw the pastor coming to dinner in this civilian elegance, which besides the suit and red tie, included colored socks and tan shoes.

14:00|It’s a delusional painter who finishes a canvas at <b>two o’clock</b> and expects radical societal transformation by four. Even when artists write manifestos, they are (hopefully) aware that their exigent tone is, finally, borrowed, only echoing and mimicking the urgency of the guerrilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests, rather than truly enacting it. The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art.|Intimations|Zadie Smith

14:00|At <b>two</b> every afternoon, the mother and son would appear at the beach. The mother always wore a plain light-colored dress with a broad-brimmed straw hat.

14:00|He told her if he had any of his weekends free he’d ask her for a date, and she said she could come to visit in two weeks if he’d tell her what time, and Billy looked at McMurphy for an answer.

14:00|At <b>two o’clock</b> back at the Weatherbys’ Sally asked her if she and Amory had had a “time” in the den. Isabelle turned to her quietly. In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate dreamer of Joan-like dreams.|This Side of Paradise|F. Scott Fitzgerald
