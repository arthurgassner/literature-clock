07:49|"When did you next see Dr. Wellesley?<br/>""At just eleven minutes to eight.""<br/>""Where?""<br/>""In the surgery.""<br/>""He came back there?""<br/>""Yes.""<br/>""How do you fix that precise time--eleven minutes to eight?""<br/>""Because he'd arranged to see a patient in Meadow Gate at ten minutes to eight. I glanced at the clock as he came in, saw what time it was, and reminded him of the appointment."""|In the Mayor's Parlour|J.S. Fletcher
