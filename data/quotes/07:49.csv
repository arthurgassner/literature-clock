""You're always right; there must be a clock in your head."""|The End of the Beginning|Ray Bradbury
07:49|"When did you next see Dr. Wellesley?
""At just <b>eleven minutes to eight</b>.""
""Where?""
""In the surgery.""
""He came back there?""
""Yes.""
""How do you fix that precise time--<b>eleven minutes to eight</b>?""
""Because he'd arranged to see a patient in Meadow Gate at ten minutes to eight. I glanced at the clock as he came in, saw what time it was, and reminded him of the appointment."""|In the Mayor's Parlour|J.S. Fletcher
