07:00|seven|At seven the next morning the telephone rang. <br>Slowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep.

He began to pace up and down the cell, six and a half steps to the window, six and a half steps back.|Darkness at Noon|Arthur Koestler
07:00|seven|I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments, only, could be taken.
