07:00|At <b>seven</b> the next morning the telephone rang. <br/>Slowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep.

07:00|Through September and right into October, the North Carolina skies were clear and the air was warm even at <b>seven in the morning</b>, when I left my second-floor apartment by the outside stairs.

07:00|The call was early: <b>seven AM</b>, two hours before the park opened its doors on another summer. The three of us walked down the beach together. Tom talked most of the way. He always talked.

07:00|In his hotel room at the Bon Voyage, Dr. Rufus Sixsmith reads a sheaf of letters written to him nearly half a century ago by his friend Robert Frobisher. Sixsmith knows them by heart, but their texture, rustle, and his friend’s faded handwriting calm his nerves. These letters are what he would save from a burning building.

Sixsmith slips the unread letters into his jacket pocket for the restaurant.|Cloud Atlas|David Mitchell

07:00|<b>Seven o’clock</b> the mess hall opens and the order of line-up reverses: the Wheelers first, then the Walkers, then Acutes pick up trays, corn flakes, bacon and eggs, toast—and this morning a canned peach on a piece of green, torn lettuce.|One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest|Ken Kesey
07:00|“What? No. I mean, yeah, that’s when we have to be in the lot, but there’s a bunch of stuff before, you know, costumes, makeup, all that. I usually get there at <b>seven</b>. I can’t believe nobody told you any of this.”|Reprieve|James Han Mattson

He began to pace up and down the cell, six and a half steps to the window, six and a half steps back.|Darkness at Noon|Arthur Koestler
07:00|I had left directions that I was to be called at <b>seven</b>; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments, only, could be taken.
