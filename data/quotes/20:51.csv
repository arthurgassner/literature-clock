20:51|I stayed watching the polestar from <b>nine minutes to nine</b> until ten past, tilting my head back till it hurt, fighting off dizziness and not taking my eyes off the distant, twinkling light which is our rendezvous in the sky, trying to see your face looking back at me.|Belle du Seigneur|Albert Cohen
