01:00|If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon is in some ways a better time to try than the middle of the night. Doors and windows are more likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren’t meaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants or grown-ups believe this if you’re found climbing out of a bedroom window at <b>one o’clock in the morning</b>.)|The Silver Chair|C.S. Lewis

01:00|I want to shout and scream, but I would be screaming at a wall. I storm off to my bedroom. Thirty minutes later, she leaves the house with Gboyega. <br/>She doesn’t return till <b>1 a.m.</b><br/>I don’t sleep till <b>1 a.m.</b>|My Sister, the Serial Killer|Oyinkan Braithwaite
01:00|It was <b>one o’clock</b> when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade|A Study in Scarlet|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
01:00|“Nobody noticed that he got off the ride without his date?”<br/>“Nope. This was mid-July, the very height of the season, and the place was a swarming madhouse. They didn’t find the body until <b>one o’clock</b> the next morning, long after the park was closed and the Horror House work-lights were turned on. For the graveyard shift, you know.”|Joyland|Stephen King

01:00|"“About <b>one o’clock</b> they moved to Maxim’s, and two found them in Deviniere’s.

01:00|He didn’t know what was at the end of the chute. The opening was narrow (though large enough to take the canary). He dreamed that the chute opened onto vast garbage bins filled with old coffee filters, ravioli in tomato sauce and mangled genitalia. Huge worms, as big as the canary, armed with terrible beaks, would attack the body. Tear off the feet, rip out its intestines, burst the eyeballs. He woke up, trembling; it was only <b>one o’clock</b>. He swallowed three Xanax. So ended his first night of freedom.|Atomised|Michel Houellebecq
01:00|I'm the only one awake in this house on this night before the day that will change all our lives. Though it's already that day: the little luminous hands on my alarm clock (which I haven't set) show just gone <b>one in the morning</b>.|Tomorrow|Graham Swift
01:00|It was the thirtieth of May by now. <b>One am</b> on the thirtieth of May 1940. Quite a famous date on which to be lying awake and staring at the ceiling. Already in the creeks and tidal estuaries of England the pleasure-boats and paddle-steamers were casting their moorings for the day trip to Dunkirk.

01:00|Cut-me-own-Throat Dibbler had wandered off and was doing a busy trade with those late-night revelers who were too drunk to prevent optimism triumphing over experience; anyone who bought a meal at <b>one a.m.</b> after a night’s reveling was probably going to be riotously ill anyway, so they might as well have something to show for it.|Moving Pictures|Terry Pratchett
01:00|Being caught at <b>one A.M.</b> in a bank’s deposit vault while wearing a black suit with lots of little pockets in it could be considered suspicious, so why do it?|Going Postal|Terry Pratchett
